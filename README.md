# Lab 3 Javaprogrammering

First big school project from ITHS.

## Description
Simple art application using JavaFX with basic network functionality.
Can save images as .svg files, has three shape options, and can send shapes over network. 
Undo & Redo functionality using command patterns.
Follows the MVC architectural pattern.

## Personal Note
Given more time, I could have done so much more with this, cleaned up the code further, 
separated the network to it's own class, added more shapes and drawing options, etc.
As is I'm still very proud of what I accomplished.
